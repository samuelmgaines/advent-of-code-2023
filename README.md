# Advent of Code 2023
A repository to hold all of my solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code challenge.
Filenames will begin with a number and a letter (either `a` or `b`). The number will be the date of the challenge, and the letter will signify whether it is the first or second challenge of the day. For example `06a.py` is the solution of the first problem from December 6th.
